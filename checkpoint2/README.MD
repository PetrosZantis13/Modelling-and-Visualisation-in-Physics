Instructions for the simulation:

1. Run the file CellularAutomata.py
2. Select between Animation('a') or Measurements('m')
3. Select the desired simulation ('g' for Game of Life or 's' for SIRS)
4. Select the system size N (resulting in an NxN square system)
5. Type in the desired initial condition

	GOL : ('r' for Random, 'o' for Oscillators, 'g' for moving Spaceship or 's' for Still states)	
	SIRS : (p1, p2, p3) for Animation
	       ('p' for Phase Diagram, 'v' for Variance Cut or 'i' for Immunity/Vaccination) for Measurements

6. Enjoy the animation! The figure remains open until the user closes it.
7. In the case of measurements, the output datafiles and plots will be saved in the created Datafiles folder.
