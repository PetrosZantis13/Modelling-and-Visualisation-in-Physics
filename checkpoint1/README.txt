Instructions for the simulation:

1. Run the file Ising.py
2. Select between Animation('a') or Measurements('m')
3. Select the system size N (resulting in an NxN square system)
4. In the case of Animation, select the temperature T
5. Select the desired dynamics to be used ('g' for Glauber or 'k' for Kawasaki)
6. Enjoy the animation! The figure remains open until the user closes it.
7. In the case of measurements, the output datafile and plots will be saved in the same directory as the Ising.py file
